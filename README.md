# TurtleGame
GUI based turtle game using Python.

This game is made using Turtle-Module(Python) for the motion of objects and to provide shape and color to the turtle(main object).

TurtleGame.py is the main file in which whole code is written and on executing that file your code runs.

Turtlegame.txt is the text file in which your HighScore is saved.

As your Score reached above the threshold of HighScore your HighScore will automatically upgrade.

* Preferred to run it using **PYTHON IDLE**.

## Movements

* Use `LEFT or RIGHT ARROW KEYS` only to move your turtle.
